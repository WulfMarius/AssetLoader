AssetLoader


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It allows loading Unity assets from external asset bundles when using UnityEngine.Resources.Load.
This mod is only infrastructure for other mods and does not provide any assets or asset bundles and does not add or modify any items or game mechanics by itself.


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to be used.
