AssetLoader


This is a library for modding **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It allows loading Unity assets from external asset bundles when using UnityEngine.Resources.Load and integrating additional Wwise SoundBanks.
This library is only infrastructure for mods and does not provide any assets, asset bundles or SoundBanks and does not add or modify any items or game mechanics by itself.


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to be used.
