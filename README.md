LoadAsset


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It allows loading assets from external asset bundles.


- Currently only adds two console commands "chair" and "binoculars" for spawning test assets.
- resources/binoculars and resources/leather_chair need to be copied to the "mods" folder
- CreateAssetBundle.cs is a script for the Unity Editor to create own asset bundles; it need to be copied into the "Assets/Editor" folder of the Unity project



Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.
