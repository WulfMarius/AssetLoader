LoadAsset


This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.


It allows loading assets from external asset bundles.


Currently only adds two console commands "chair" and "binoculars" for spawning test assets.


Requires the [Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) to run.
